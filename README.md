# TransAndalus

[https://www.transandalus.org](TransAndalus) new web site.

# Technology used

This application uses AngularJS.

# Build

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Grunt][] as our build system. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Run the following command to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    grunt

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.

# Building for production

To optimize the TransAndalus site for production, run:

    grunt build

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.
